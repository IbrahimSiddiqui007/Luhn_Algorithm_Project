Credit card numbers follow certain patterns. A credit card number must have between 13 and 16 digits. It must start with:
4 for Visa cards
5 for Master cards
37 for American Express cards 6 for Discover cards
In 1954, Hans Luhn of IBM proposed an algorithm for validating credit card numbers. The algorithm is useful to determine if a card number is entered correctly or if a credit card is scanned correctly by a scanner. Almost all credit card numbers are generated following this validity check, commonly known as the Luhn check or the Mod 10 check, which can be described as follows (for illustration, consider the card number 4388576018402626):
1. Double every second digit from right to left. If doubling of a digit results in a two-digit number, add up the two digits to get a single-digit number.
2 * 2 =4
2 * 2 =4
4 * 2 =8
1 * 2 =2
6 * 2 = 12 (1 + 2 = 3) 5 * 2 = 10 (1 + 0 = 1) 8 * 2 = 16 (1 + 6 = 7) 4 * 2 =8
2. Now add all single-digit numbers from Step 1. 4 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 8 = 37
3. Add all digits in the odd places from right to left in the card number. 6 + 6 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 38
4. Sum the results from Step 2 and Step 3. 37 + 38 = 75
5. If the result from Step 4 is divisible by 10, the card number is valid; otherwise, it is invalid. For example, the number 4388576018402626 is invalid, but the number 4388576018410707 is valid.

TASK
 
 Write a complete program (with multiple methods) that prompts the user to enter:
INPUT
a) the total number of credit cards
b) the credit card numbers as a long integers in new lines
OUTPUT
- Display whether the credit card is visa, master, American express or discover card
- Display whether the number is valid or invalid.
- Suggest a FIX to the invalid credit card numbers by modifying the LAST NUMBER
ONLY. ( In our example, 4388576018402626 resulted in 75 which is NOT divisible by 10. To fix that we need to either change 75 to 70 or to 80. Hence the 6 must be changed to 1, so that total after calculation is 70 and hence a suggested fix)
